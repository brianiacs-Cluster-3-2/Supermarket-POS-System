# Supermarket-POS-System
We are creating Point of Sales System version 1.0, a commercial service that leverages a 
client’s existing Point of Sales (POS) system to create, update, and maintain an online store. 
Our POS system establishes a connection between a local POS and a cloud-based web service. 
The cloud-based web service in turn establishes and hosts a web store for a given client. Our 
Supermarket POS system maintains and updates manual POS and online databases while 
facilitating online transactions for a given client
This system will include supermarket grocery, product selling, buying, customer details, and 
so more work. The web application will be developed using some technologies. Here the first 
user/admin must pass through login to the system to get access, then the admin can manage 
product details, purchase details, selling details, and customer details and the system shows 
sales contact details, reports, and expense details at the same time admin can manage the 
system settings.
Our system is a “BRAINIACS SUPERMARKET POS SYSTEM”, this system is an online 
web base application, nowadays many supermarkets are kept their records manually, but 
that’s so difficult, for example, many supermarkets manage their customer records, 
supermarket grocery products reports, customer bill paying methods are managed manually, 
and desktop POS can’t access the system through the web or online, In this situation main 
admin/owner cannot view the current supermarket status any place at the moment. This is also 
a major problem of the General supermarket system. But our POS will overcome these all 
problems, we are creating Point of Sales System version 1.0 is a commercial service that 
leverages a client’s existing Point of Sales (POS) system to create, update, and maintain an 
online store. Our POS system establishes a connection between a local POS and a cloud-based 
web service. The cloud-based web service in turn establishes and hosts a web store for a given 
client. Our supermarket POS system maintains and updates both manual POS and online 
databases, while also facilitating online transactions for a given client.

Our supermarket POS System is designed to run on a local host web server, PHP, and existing 
databases, to host, maintain and secure individual clients’ web stores and account information. 
Supermarket POS System also includes a cloud-based client-side service which online 
interactions between the client’s manual POS and the supermarket POS System server.

## DESIGNS
According to our project, we used many technologies to create this project, so our project UI design
part totally covered “Html, CSS, bootstrap, and JavaScript” these languages. And the other hands the 
functional part we used “JavaScript, jQuery, and PHP ” to implement successfully and the database/ 
backhand part covered fully “PHP, and MySQL.”, so all of these project designs are so attractive.

Our supermarket online POS (point of sale) system is a web-based software that allows 
businesses to process sales transactions and manage inventory remotely. The design of an 
online POS system can vary depending on the specific needs of the business and the type of 
industry it operates, but some key components to consider include:
